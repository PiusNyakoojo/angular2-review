/*
	To help debug your angular 2 application, you can use Chrome's dev tools with Ctrl + Shift + J and looking at
	Sources. There you should find the javascript files that are compiled for you by the angular cli.

	The angular 2 cli also provides us with source maps that map the compiled javascript code to our written
	typescript code.

	In Sources, if you navigate to file:// -> C:/Users/Your_user_name -> app.component.ts or whatever your 
	typescript file is called, you can add breakpoints in the code.

	Augury is another greate angular 2 tool to use when debugging: https://augury.angular.io

	It helps visualize the application through component trees and visual debugging tools
